In the worst case, the number of calls to the recursive method compute(i,j)
precessing an array of size n is:
T(n) = 1+T(n-1)
     = 1+ (1+T(n-2)) = 2 + T(n-2)
     = 3 + T(n-3)
     ...
     = n-2+T(2)

T(n) gets smaller until the base case T(2) = 1.
Thus, T(n) = n-2 + 1 = n-1.
So, the run time in the worst case is proportional to n-1 and hence it is O(n).
